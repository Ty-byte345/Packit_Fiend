# Packit_Fiend
A Python-based network pentesting tool designed for security assessments and exploitation simulations.
I’ve been working on a personal pentesting project, and I’m excited to share the details with you. Meet **pACKit_fi3ND**, a comprehensive pentesting tool that can be used for:

🔍 **Port Scanning**: Identifying open ports on target machines.  
💻 **Packet Sniffing**: Analyzing network traffic in real-time.  
🌐 **Network Discovery**: Scanning IP ranges for live devices in a network.  
💥 **Post-Exploitation Tools**: Establishing backdoors, gathering system info, uploading malicious payloads, and executing remote commands.

### Key Features:
- **Port Scanner**: Scans ports and reports open ones on the target machine.  
- **Packet Sniffer**: Monitors packets in the network, filtering by target IP.  
- **Network Discovery**: Detects all devices in a specified IP range.  
- **Backdoor Server**: Sets up a backdoor to remotely control compromised systems.  
- **Remote Command Execution**: Remotely run commands and exfiltrate data from compromised systems.

### Usage:
The tool provides an interactive interface for pentesters to quickly navigate between various tests. Whether you're conducting reconnaissance or post-exploitation, **pACKit_fi3ND** simplifies the entire process. Here's what it looks like:

1. Port scan your target and identify open ports.  
2. Start sniffing the network and capture valuable packets.  
3. Discover all devices on the network.  
4. If you're in post-exploitation mode, execute commands, upload payloads, and get system info. 

The tool is designed with Python, leveraging libraries like `scapy`, `socket`, and `platform`, ensuring flexibility and powerful scanning capabilities. 🐍⚡
