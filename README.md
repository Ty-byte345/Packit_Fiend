# Packit_Fiend
A Python-based network pentesting tool designed for security assessments and exploitation simulations.
I‚Äôve been working on an ongoing personal pentesting project to test my skills and implement my knowledge in the art of cybersecurity & pentesting,and I‚Äôm excited to share the details with you. Meet **pACKit_fi3ND**, a comprehensive pentesting tool that can be used for:

üîç **Port Scanning**: Identifying open ports on target machines.  
üíª **Packet Sniffing**: Analyzing network traffic in real-time.  
üåê **Network Discovery**: Scanning IP ranges for live devices in a network.  
üí• **Post-Exploitation Tools**: Establishing backdoors, gathering system info, uploading malicious payloads, and executing remote commands.

### Key Features:
- **Port Scanner**: Scans ports and reports open ones on the target machine.  
- **Packet Sniffer**: Monitors packets in the network, filtering by target IP.  
- **Network Discovery**: Detects all devices in a specified IP range.  
- **Backdoor Server**: Sets up a backdoor to remotely control compromised systems.  
- **Remote Command Execution**: Remotely run commands and exfiltrate data from compromised systems.

### Usage:
The tool provides an interactive interface for pentesters to quickly navigate between various tests. Whether you're conducting reconnaissance or post-exploitation, **pACKit_fi3ND** simplifies the entire process. Here's what it looks like:

1. Port scan your target and identify open ports.  
2. Start sniffing the network and capture valuable packets.  
3. Discover all devices on the network.  
4. If you're in post-exploitation mode, execute commands, upload payloads, and get system info.

The tool is designed with Python, leveraging libraries like `scapy`, `socket`, and `platform`, ensuring flexibility and powerful scanning capabilities. üêç‚ö°
